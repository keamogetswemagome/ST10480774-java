        <p>Saskos Kitchen is committed to sourcing local, sustainable, and organic ingredients<br>
           whenever possible. We prepare everything from scratch with care and passion, using <br>
           only premium ingredients.<br>
           <br>
          We believe in treating people right our employees earn living wages, and tips are<br>

            environmental footprint in everything we do.<br>
            <br>
          These commitments may mean slightly higher menu prices, but we hope you see the value<br>

            Every day, we’re working to get better at what matters most.</p>
